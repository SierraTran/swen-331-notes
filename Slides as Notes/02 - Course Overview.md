# Course Overview

## Vulnerability of the Day

- Each day, we will cover a different type of code-level vulnerability
	- Usually a demo
	- How to avoid, detect, and mitigate the issue
- Most will link to the Common Weakness Enumeration
	- http://cwe.mitre.org

## Required Reading

- No textbook in this class, but... [Common Weakness Enumeration](http://cwe.mitre.org)
- Exams will emphasize lectures.
- Reading supports the lectures and VOTD

## In-Class Activities

- Most days, we will cover a tool or technique
- Many activities are interactive and collaborative in natures
- Activities are for learning
	- Formative feedback, not summative
	- No submissions (usually) – instructor checks in class
	- Exams **will have questions** about those activities

## Attendance

- Historically, grades are correlated to _attendance_ and _questions_
	- "What if..."
	- "Can I try summarizing this?"
- Attendance will be checked on days we do group activities
	- If you are not present on an activity day, you'll need to do the entire activity yourself
- Course is recorded on Panopto, on myCourses
	- Transcriptions are turn on
	- Warning: everyone _thinks_ they'll rewatch the lectures...

## Exams

- Exam 1, Exam 2, & Final Exam

- Closed book
- Closed computer
- Covers lecture material, VotD, readings, projects, and activities

## Quizzes

- Exam 1 Practice Required Practice Quiz
- Filesystem Permissions Quiz
- ...maybe more? likely just those two

- On myCourses, done outside of class. Usually allows repeat attempts
- Goal: low stress points and review

## Fuzz Testing Project

- We will have one larger programming project
	- Build a tool for automated security testing
	- Web applications
	- Continuous Integration
	- Individuals, not teams
- Goal:
	- How do we automate exploratory testing?
	- What can be automated easily, what can't?

## Input Handling Project

- 1.5-week project covering:
	- Block lists, allow lists
	- Regular expressions
	- Unicode handling
- More of "lab" than project
	- Highly guided, ~50 steps
	- Unit test-driven
	- Uses node.js (Javascript), but the JS isn't the hard part

## TBD

- We're going to be experimenting with a new project this year.
	- Programming
	- 1-2 weeks
	- Individual
	- Likely topic: inter-process communication and distrustful decomposition

## Vulnerability History Project (Removed?)

- What are the origins of past vulnerabilities?
	- What are the mistakes that led to a vulnerability being introduced and missed?
	- What can we learn from history?
- Some writing, lots of investigation
- Peer review process as well

## Case Study

- Choose a large software project to study
	- Source code must be available (>10k SLOC)
	- Domain must have security risks
	- History of vulnerabilities must be available
	- Instructor approved
- Paper with chapters on:
	- Security risks of the domain
	- Design risks
	- Code inspection results
- Iterative paper writing
	- Multiple submissions
	- You are graded on the content and how you react to my feedback

## Reading Quizzes (Removed?)

- McGraw has a different approach and perspective worth seeing
- Quizzes will be:
	- Done through myCourses
	- On your own time (i.e. open book)
	- Multiple choice
	- Multiple attempts

## Wellness

- Computers are isolating.
	- "I feel like I should already know this."
	- "Everyone else knows this besides me."
- How we combat isolation in 331
	- Talk to people
	- Form a study group
	- Ask for help:
		- In class
		- Ask me after class, office hours
		- Ask TA
		- Ask classmates
		- SSE
- I love to talk! About anything!
